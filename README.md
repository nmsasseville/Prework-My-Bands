    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Oscar Peterson is a celebrated Canadian jazz pianist and virtuoso. He was born in Montreal, Canada, on August 15, 1925. His parents were immigrants from the West Indies who had come to Canada when his father, Daniel Peterson, went to work with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Daniel was an amateur trumpeter and pianist, and he, along with Oscar's sister, Daisy, helped Oscar first learn the piano. He studied classical music and practiced for hours daily, developing somewhat of a reputation for himself as a piano prodigy by the age of nine. In addition to classical piano, he also became proficient in ragtime, jazz, and boogie-woogie music, and was well known for his abilities in boogie-woogie, becoming known as the "Brown Bomber." By the age of 14, he dropped out of school to become a professional musician, and continued to develop a name for himself as he collaborated with other bands and musicians. In his early 20's he was discovered by Norman Granz, who heard him on the radio while he was playing in a live broadcast at a local club. Granz became his long-time manager, with whom he developed a relationship of mutual respect. Peterson began recording albums beginning in the early 1950's and continued recording until 2007, when his declining health took him away from his music. Over the course of his career he won many different awards, including 8 grammies and a BBC Radio Lifetime Achievement Award. He often collaborated with other musicians in duos, trios, and quartets. He died at home in Mississauga, Ontario, of kidney failure on December 23, 2007.
